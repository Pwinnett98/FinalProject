# FinalProject
Final Project for Advanced Buisness Programming 
Your Name: 

You will create your own GitHub repository. There is no GitHub Classroom link.
o On GitHub.com click New Repository. Give your repository a unique name.
o Make your repo Public so I can view it. You can share ideas and collaborate with each
other as long as you all write your own code.
o Create a .gitignore file that contains “bin/” and “obj/”.
• Your web application should have at least TWO database tables implemented as entity classes.
• Follow steps 1-8 from Week 13 to create your ASP.NET Core project with EF Core.
• Use scaffolding (for step 8) on one of your entity classes.
• Write code to display or modify related data. This can’t be scaffolded.
o For example, if you have students and courses the course page should list the students
in the course. Each student page should list the courses that student is in.
o Another example would be to have a button or form for a student to add/drop a course.
• Seed the database with records for all your entities. Ensure that one entity has enough records
(at least 25) to support paging.
• Add Data Validation to all the necessary properties.
• Add paging support to a razor page. For example, list only ten records at a time and allow the
user to navigate to the next and previous pages. Disable the next/prev buttons as appropriate.
• Add a search bar to at least one razor page. Allow the user to type in a search string and show
only those results.
• Allow the user to sort on at least one record both ascending and descending – OR – filter
records using a SelectList.
• Add links to all appropriate pages in the navigation bar
